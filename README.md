# Hello, World
Let me tell you a bit about myself.
I'm Omega, a.k.a Omega207, and I wish to become a Video Game developer.
 Diving deep, I also like to glitch/cheat on video games.
 Of course, only to myself.
 Sorry to say I don't have any social media accounts (for certain reasons), but I aim to make cool repositories on Github.
 Specifically, I (would) like to make new things out of old programs (e.g. PKSM, last updated in July, 2020.).
                             Thanks for reading this repo. I wish you a happy day.
